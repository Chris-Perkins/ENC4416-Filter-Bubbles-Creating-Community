Q3:
How much do you know about the "Incel" community?
	A1:	Nothing
	A2:	I've heard of them but don't know much
	A3:	I'm familiar with them

	The "Incel" community is an excellent example of what can happen when people are isolated from others by being put into a bubble. Incels are misogonistic men who for whatever reason donâ€™t have any luck with female relationships. Their response to this is to blame females for being too shallow rather than looking inwards at their extremely unhealthy attitudes which drive everyone away. This community has gradually radicalized itself due to its isolation and developed increasingly extreme opinions. Multiple mass shooters have been self-reported incels. [1]

Q4:
Have you ever been to 4chan's /pol board?
	A1:	No
	A2:	I've looked out of curiosity
	A3:	I'm a regular

	When tiny communities are isolated in bubbles (be it be by filter bubbles or human behavior itself), that community may end up radicalizing [1]. Extreme voices are the loudest and calls for self-reflection can often be drowned out [2]. Without outside intervention, you may end up with the development of all kinds of nasty behavior the internet is famous for.

Q5:
Have you noticed increasing political polarization?
	A1:	Absolutely
	A2:	I've seen hints of it
	A3:	Not at all

	Political polarization is the distancing of people from political common ground. It happens when people isolate themselves from the other side causing a gradual drift towards the extremes of the political spectrum [1]. At the extremes, the "Unite the Right" march in Fergusson to promote facism and anti-semetism [2] and Antifa promoting violence and perpetuating violence against republican voices [3]. It takes a fresh perspective to steer communities away from the extremes and those perspectives can be hard to find when the people you interact with all agree with you.
